10-Pin Bowling in javascript

I forked this repository from [Snozza](https://github.com/snozza). I had been feeling quite dispondent about my own attempt at a bowling score card and was really impressed with how incredibly concise his was. Whilst his code was so much more elegant and concise than my own, I realised that I was able to refactor it to make it a little DRYer.
